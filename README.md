# TCATabNavigationDemo  

In many iOS apps, including those provided by Apple, certain behaviors are commonly observed when tapping on the active tab in a tab bar:

- If there is a screen transition, it navigates back to the root of the screen stack.
- If the screen is scrolled, it scrolls back to the top.

Moreover, when utilizing SwiftUI as the UI framework, developers often prefer The Composable Architecture provided by [pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) as the application architecture.

This repository contains a demo app that showcases the aforementioned behavior using SwiftUI with TCA architecture.

## Environment

- Xcode 15.3
- iOS 17 or later
- swift-composable-architecture 1.9.2
